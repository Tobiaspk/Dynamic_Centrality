## Description

Capture the relative importance of users in a dynamic time framework - discrete and continuous - using the algorithm introduced in *Grindrod & Higham (2012): A matrix iteration for dynamic network summaries*.
The proposed algorithm can be regarded as a generalisation of Dynamic Communicability Matrix Centrality Models and Alpha Centralities.
